# Pipeline example
This docker compose example is intended to demonstrate how to use the pipeline `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`.

You can run it locally with the following command:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You'll need to change the image name in the `docker-compose.yml` file to match your Docker Hub repository.
